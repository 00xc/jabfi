# jabfi #
jabfi is just another [Brainfuck](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/brainfuck.html) interpreter.
It is very simple (for now), yet fast. It does not pre-compile, nor optimize any code, nor check memory bounds. It DOES check for matching `[` and `]`.

## Usage ##
Compile with `make` and run as `./jabfi <program_file.b>`.
